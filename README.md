# ags_9verb_template
9 Verb template for Adventure Game Studio

This template adds a 9 Verb GUI to AGS,  similar to the ones in classic LucasArts Games.
The graphics included may be freely used and altered in any way.

The development of this template has ended, it will still receive bugfixes, but no more features will be added. If you are starting a new project, please consider using its successor "Tumbleweed Verbs".
